# Auto Load Next Post Theme Support

This repository contains support for various WordPress themes that require a little help with either just the template or theme selectors or both. Here you will find themes that have been tested and verified with Auto Load Next Post.

Simply select the folder of the theme you want to support and read the instructions provided.

If a theme that you want is not listed then you will need to purchase the [setup support](https://autoloadnextpost.com/product/setup-support/) where we can help you.

If you want to provide us with a theme that you have tested the plugin with then please follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/seb86/alnp-theme-support/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you. :smile:
